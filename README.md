# Getting Started

The Svrf API allows you to supercharge your project or app with the first and largest search engine for immersive experiences. We make it simple for any developer to incorporate highly immersive experiences with all kinds of applications: virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, mobile, and web.

The Svrf API is based on REST principles, allowing it to integrate cross-platform. Our endpoints return responses in [JSON][]. We support [CORS][], allowing you to access immersive experiences indexed by Svrf on your own web domains. We provide a variety of resolutions, projections, and file formats to support most modern clients.

Svrf API Documentation is available at [https://developers.svrf.com][Svrf Dev].

## API Highlights

## Search Endpoint

[The Svrf Search Endpoint][Docs Search] brings the power of immersive search found on [Svrf.com][Svrf] to your app or project. Our search engine enables your users to instantly find the immersive experience they're seeking. Content is sorted by the Svrf rating system, ensuring that the highest quality content and most relevant search results are returned first.

### Trending Endpoint

[The Svrf Trending Endpoint][Docs Trending] provides your app or project with the hottest immersive content - curated by real humans. The experiences returned mirror the [Svrf homepage][Svrf], from timely cultural content to trending pop-culture references. The trending experiences are updated regularly to ensure users always get fresh updates of immersive content.
